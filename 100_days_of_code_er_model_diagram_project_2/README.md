### **How to Draw the ER Diagram**  
You can use any diagramming tool of your choice, such as:  
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)  
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)  
- [Draw.io (diagrams.net)](https://www.diagrams.net/)  

### **Example ER Model (Pinterest)**  

Let's assume the main entities in Pinterest are User, Board, Pin, and Comment.

- User: UserID (PK), Username, Email, Password, DateJoined, etc.
    - Each user can create multiple Boards (One-to-Many relation between User and Board).
    - Each user can make several Pins (One-to-Many relation between User and Pin).
    - Each user can post numerous Comments (One-to-Many relation between User and Comment).
- Board: BoardID (PK), BoardName, CreationDate, UserID (FK), etc.
    - Each Board can contain multiple Pins (One-to-Many relation between Board and Pin).
    - Each Board is owned by a single User.
- Pin: PinID (PK), ImageURL, Description, UserID (FK), BoardID (FK), etc.
    - Each Pin can have numerous Comments (One-to-Many relation between Pin and Comment).
    - Each Pin is owned by a single User.
    - Each Pin is contained in a single Board.
- Comment: CommentID (PK), Text, UserID (FK), PinID (FK), etc.
    - Each Comment is associated with a single Pin.
    - Each Comment is posted by a single User.

Using this ER model, you should draw an **ER diagram** for the application you choose.
